                    <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                    <h2>
                        Dogs have a sense of time but don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äòconcept‚Äô of time. Unlike humans, dogs don‚Äôt have the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don‚Äôt know how to read clocks. So, telling them ‚ÄùI‚Äôll be back in 15 minutes‚Äù won‚Äôt really do much, but we understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov‚Äôs dogs are the perfect example of this.
